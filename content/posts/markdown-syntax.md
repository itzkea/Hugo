|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|

Roses are the queens of the flower world, popular for their classic beauty and romantic symbolism. They come in a rainbow of colours, with each colour telling a different story of love, friendship, or respect. They are also associated with people born in June. Roses are known for their layered petals and rich fragrance, which has made them a favourite in perfumery for centuries. Whether in a lavish bouquet or a single stem, roses capture hearts everywhere.


### Lilies

Lilies are stunning and fragrant, with large, bell-shaped flowers that make a dramatic statement. They come in many beautiful colours and are often used in celebrations for their luxurious appearance and heavenly scent. Lilies are not only stunning and fragrant, but they also play a significant role in cultural symbols across the world. In various cultures, lilies represent purity and refined beauty. Some species, like the water lily, hold religious significance in Eastern cultures.


### Tulips

|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|

Tulips are springtime stars with their clean, elegant shape and a cheerful palette of colours. These bulbs are some of the earliest to bloom in spring, making them a symbol of rebirth and new beginnings. Tulips are native to Central Asia, but gained popularity in the Netherlands in the 17th century, sparking "Tulip Mania" during which bulbs were incredibly valuable. Tulips are perfect for gardens, pots, and as cut flowers in stunning floral arrangements.


### Carnation

Carnations are a favourite for their beautifully ruffled petals, long-lasting blooms, and delightful sweet and spicy scent. They come in a fantastic array of colours, brightening up any bouquet or floral display. Known to symbolise love and deep fascination, carnations are a top pick for everything from stunning floral arrangements to charming boutonnieres. Plus, they hold a special place as the birth month flower for January, making them an extra meaningful gift at the start of the year.


### Sunflower

|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|

Sunflowers are like big, sunny smiles on tall stalks, famous for their huge, bright yellow petals and hearty seeds that both birds and people love to eat. Sunflowers are special because they can turn their heads to follow the sun from sunrise to sunset. This trick makes them a symbol of energy and love. Sunflowers aren't just grown for their looks but also for their seeds, which give us healthy oils and tasty snacks. Plus, they can be used to make biodiesel fuel and even help clean up the soil.


### Daisy

|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|

Daisies are a great symbol of happiness. Their simple white petals and bright yellow centres remind us of sunny days and open fields. Daisies are tough and flexible, symbolising purity and innocence, and they are the birth flower for April. They are also really good at adapting and can be found almost everywhere in the world except for Antarctica. The name "daisy" comes from "day's eye" because the flower opens in the morning and closes at night. Plus, what looks like one single daisy flower is actually made up of many small flowers grouped together.


## Peony

Peonies are all about lush abundance and fluffy petals. They have a luxurious appearance and a sweet fragrance. Peonies come in pink, red, white and yellow and represent wealth and honour, making them popular for special occasions. Peonies originally come from Asia, Southern Europe, and Western North America, but they are especially loved in Eastern cultures, like in China where they are called the "king of flowers."


## Hyacinth

Hyacinths are loved for their wonderful fragrance and dense, starry flowers. They bloom in early spring and come in vivid colours like pink, purple, and white. A garden or a home with hyacinths smells as lovely as it looks. Hyacinths are loved not just for their wonderful smell and full blooms but also for their story in Greek mythology. The legend says that the flower grew from the blood of a young man named Hyacinthus after he was accidentally killed by the god Apollo. This story links the flower to ideas of new beginnings and the start of spring.


## Lavender

Lavender is famous for its calming fragrance and pretty purple blooms. Itâ€™s widely used in essential oils and perfumes, and it's just as delightful in gardens, attracting bees and butterflies. Lavender is not just loved for its smell and looks, it's also useful for calming skin irritations and burns, including bug bites.


## Aster

Asters are true stars of autumn, blooming brightly when many other flowers start to fade. These flowers look like daisies and come in vibrant colours like blue, pink, and purple. Mostly found in North America, asters are said to be made from stardust and represent love and patience. The aster is also the birth month flower of September. Asters attract butterflies and keep gardens colourful late into the season, adding life even as it gets cooler.
